##### **Cloning of the ORANGE knockin construct**   

**1. Dissolve target primers to 100 µM in H<sub>2</sub>O or TE buffer**   

**2. Digest plasmid (pORANGE, pOC1, pOC2, pOC3, pOC4, or pOC5) with BbsI**  

**3. Anneal target primer pair**    
- combine:    
        - 5 µl oligo 1 (100 µM)   
        - 5 µl oligo 2 (100 µM)    
        - 2 µl buffer (for example Tango or NEB3 buffer)    
        - 8 µl H<sub>2</sub>O     
        -----------------+    
         20 µl    
        
* Incubate at 98<sup>o</sup>C for 4 min. 
* Incubate at RT for 15 min.
* Incubate at 4<sup>o</sup>C for 10-15 min.
* Dilute 1 μl oligos in 250 μl H<sub>2</sub>O      
* Vortex and immediately take 1 μl from this 250x diluted stock and add to 8 μl H<sub>2</sub>O + 1 μl 10x NEB3 buffer     
  (final dilution 2,500x)

**4. Ligation of annealed target primers into ORANGE plasmid**
- Prepare ligation mix:  
        - 4 μl annealed oligos (2,500x dilution)   
        - 25 ng plasmid digested with BbsI (from step 2)   
        - 1 μl T4 ligase   
        - 2 μl T4 ligase buffer  
        - .. µl H<sub>2</sub>O   
        -----------------+    
        20 µl    

- Incubate at RT for 5 – 60 minutes
- Transform 5 μl ligation in 50 μl competent bacteria
- Grow O/N at 37<sup>o</sup>C
- Screen and select colonies that contain the target sequence via digestion / sequencing. Optional sequencing primers:     
        forward: 5’ AAGGCTGTTAGAGAGATAATTGGAA  3’       
        reverse: 5’ CGGGCCATTTACCGTAAGTT  3’    
- This the intermediate ORANGE construct   

**4. PCR amplify donor sequence and ligate into intermediate ORANGE construct**

- Perform a PCR using the donor primers to produce the donor fragment. Note: A standard PCR protocol is fine. However, since the initial binding part of the primers has a lower melting temperature compared to full end product, we advise to use a PCR program with a higher annealing temperature towards that later cycles.
- Digest the donor PCR and intermediate construct with HindIII and XhoI.
- Ligate the digested donor into the digested intermediate construct
- Screen colonies for the correct construct
